# what is this for 
ive been working with a few programers and this took me a while to figure out on my own giving my experience with golang, and 0 online help, if you want the source code i can show you on my discord `ArkAngel#0287` however again this is just to make a simple login system in go, make it so people do not have access to your scripts without a login key
<br>
# simple ideas 
have fun~~~
